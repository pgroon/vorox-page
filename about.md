# About Vorox Audio

As an advocate for all things open source, my recording setup is based on linux and exclusively uses open source tools. Most of my work is done in [Ardour](https://ardour.org) with various plug-ins such as the [Helm Synthesizer](https://tytel.org/helm/), the [LSP-suite](https://lsp-plug.in), and [noise repellent](https://github.com/licianodato/noise-repellent/).

I use linux and FOSS tools for auxilliary work as well. Notably, the Vorox logo was designed and realized in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org).


## About This Website

You may have noticed that this website did not greet you with a cookie banner. That's because it does not use any. One of the reasons I love free and open source software is that it doesn't track me, and so of course I made sure my website won't track you either.

This website is fully static, written in nothing but vanilla HTML and CSS. There's no Wordpress or Typo3 under the hood; In fact, it doesn't even use JavaScript. The typefaces are locally hosted so that your browser can render them without having to talk to google. Because maintaining static sites can be somewhat of a hassle, I use 11ty/eleventy so I can modularize and work with templates. If you're interested in the technical stuff, feel free to take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/pgroon/vorox-page).


## Licensing

As you might infer from the above, I aim to keep my licenses as liberal and permissive as possible. As this is new territory for me, this is still very much a work in progress.
