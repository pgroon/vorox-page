# About Vorox Audio

As an advocate for all things open source, nearly all my workflows are based on open source tools. Harware projects are realized using [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org) for electronics, [KiKit](https://github.com/yaqwsx/KiKit) for getting the PCBs production-ready, and [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org) for enclosures and other 3D-stuff. Check out my [projects](/projects/) for examples.

My recording setup is based on linux and exclusively uses open source tools. Most of my work is done in [Ardour](https://ardour.org) with various plug-ins such as the [Helm Synthesizer](https://tytel.org/helm/), the [LSP-suite](https://lsp-plug.in), and [noise repellent](https://github.com/licianodato/noise-repellent/). More recently, I have started to use the [Composer's Desktop Project](https://www.composersdesktop.com) through a new and innovative frontend called [SoundThread](https://github.com/j-p-higgins/SoundThread), which I just mention here because those projects deserve every bit of attention.

I use linux and FOSS tools for auxilliary work as well. Notably, the Vorox logo was designed and realized in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org).


## About This Website

You may have noticed that this website did not greet you with a cookie banner. That's because it does not use any. One of the reasons I love free and open source software is that it doesn't track me, and so of course I made sure my website won't track you either.

This website is fully static, written in nothing but vanilla HTML and CSS. There's no Wordpress or Typo3 under the hood; In fact, it doesn't even use JavaScript. The typefaces are locally hosted so that your browser can render them without having to talk to google. Because maintaining static sites can be somewhat of a hassle, I use 11ty/eleventy so I can modularize and work with templates. If you're interested in the technical stuff, feel free to take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/pgroon/vorox-page).
