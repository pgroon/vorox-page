# Hi, I'm Phil.

I record stuff, build microphones, and love to mess around with all things audio. You can hire me for voice over work via [fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/sellers/voroxaudio/) or [upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01d627231ceb2e9d52), buy some of my curated [sound packs](/soundpacks/) for film or video game production, or [contact me directly](mailto:hello@voroxaudio.de) to talk about whatever project you have in mind.

If you want an example of my work, check out my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@VOROX_Audio/videos) and listen to me narrate short stories from a variety of authors.
