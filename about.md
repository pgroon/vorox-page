# About Vorox Audio

My daytime job involves a lot of requirement engineering. I pride myself in having a keen eye for the needs of all kinds of different stakeholders. At Vorox Audio, I try not only to focus on crafting good audio, but also in creating a product that maximises ease-of-use with sensible structures and good metadata. I don't just want you to enjoy the sounds - I want you to enjoy working with them.

As an advocate for all things open source, my recording setup is based on linux and exclusively uses open source tools. Most of my work is done in [Ardour](https://ardour.org) with various plug-ins such as the [Helm Synthesizer](https://tytel.org/helm/), the [LSP-suite](https://lsp-plug.in), and [noise repellent](https://github.com/licianodato/noise-repellent/). More recently, I have started to use the [Composer's Desktop Project](https://www.composersdesktop.com) through a new and innovative frontend called [SoundThread](https://github.com/j-p-higgins/SoundThread).

I use linux and FOSS tools for auxilliary work as well. Notably, the Vorox logo was designed and realized in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org).


## About This Website

You may have noticed that this website did not greet you with a cookie banner. That's because it does not use any. One of the reasons I love free and open source software is that it doesn't track me, and so of course I made sure my website won't track you either.

This website is fully static, written in nothing but vanilla HTML and CSS. There's no Wordpress or Typo3 under the hood; In fact, it doesn't even use JavaScript. The typefaces are locally hosted so that your browser can render them without having to talk to google. Because maintaining static sites can be somewhat of a hassle, I use 11ty/eleventy so I can modularize and work with templates. If you're interested in the technical stuff, feel free to take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/pgroon/vorox-page).


## Licensing

As you might infer from the above, I aim to keep my licensing as liberal and permissive as possible. Read the full licensing terms <a href="/license/">here</a>.
