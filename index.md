# Hi, I'm Phil. <br>This is where I build things.

This website is meant to document and showcase my audio projects. From custom microphone builds and other electronics, various software scripts I use in my workflow, the design work that goes into [this homepage](/about/), building custom sound effects and possible future product design. I also do some narration & voice over work, samples of which you can find on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@VOROX_Audio/videos).

If you're interested in any of my work, or are working on something similar and just want to have a chat, feel free to send me an email:
