# Clean Sound. Maximum Impact.

I continuously work on this website and will continue to do so for some time. Right now, there's not much to see, as I still work on laying the technical groundwork and record demo content as well as continue working on completing sound packs for release.  
Please check back here in a couple of weeks; your patience is appreciated. If you're really curious, you can check the [github repo](https://github.com/pgroon/vorox-page) of this website's source code to watch the progress.

In the meantime, you can find my already released work on [itch.io](https://voroxaudio.itch.io/) or [send me an email](mailto:hello@voroxaudio.de) if you have any questions.
