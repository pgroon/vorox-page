## Audio that works. Nothing that doesn't.

This website is still a work in progress, as I continue laying the technical groundwork and record demo content as well as recording and preparing more sound packs for release.  
Please check back here in a couple of weeks; your patience is appreciated. If you're really curious, you can check the [github repo](https://github.com/pgroon/vorox-page) of this website's source code to watch the progress.

In the meantime, you can find my already released work on [itch.io](https://voroxaudio.itch.io/) or [send me an email](mailto:hello@voroxaudio.de) if you have any questions.

## What Vorox Offers

- Curated sound packs for film and video game design
